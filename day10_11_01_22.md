Day 10.

Started to create medical company database tables. Created patient table, exam table and a relationsheep between them. Also created medicine table. 
I had a problem with an implementing a relationsheep between medicine table and an exam table (connection tables via intermediate table). But I've solved it by writing manual SQL command of creating "Foreign keys" and references for two columns.
