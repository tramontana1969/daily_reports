Day 13.

Connected php-PDO to the database docker host. At the begining there were problems with connection because I was connecting php file to the database outside of the docker container. Solved problem by using '0.0.0.0:6033'. 
Created views of the tables in browser by using PDO. Firstly was trying to use 'prepare()' with 'execute()' functions. But for the getting data and implementing normal table view decided to use 'query()', 'fetch()' and loop.
