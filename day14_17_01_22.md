Day 14.

Divided all tables into different PHP files. Created HTML forms for adding data into database and connected it with detached PHP scripts. Had some problems with connecting HTML forms with PHP scripts which consist of SQL queries, but the problems were solved. Also implemented selection toolbar in forms in rows, where tables are connected with other tables by foreign keys.
