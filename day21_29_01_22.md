Day 21.

Solved promblems with Laravel migrations. Forgot that columns in database should be added manually. 
Also had problems with connection to the server, but after adding config file in "docker-compose/nginx" directory problem was solved.
Created patients table with data and implemented table view of all data via controllers and blade. 
Created adding data forms under the data table. (Had problems with Laravel forms and redirection on the start page). Solved that problem by "$request" and "validate".
Also created links and views single patient by ID.
