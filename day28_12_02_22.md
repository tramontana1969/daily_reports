Day 28.

Configured React and Redux in Auction Laravel project. Rendered all tables and added css styles.
Had problems with Redux. With reducers, actions, states, routers etc...
The problems were solved by reading documentation, watching examples.

Now have problems with rendering single element by ID. Can't get ID and pass it to the function.
