Day 2.

Was reading "ProGIT". 
Configured a PHP interpreter in PhpStorm. 
Was training on the "Codewars".
Started to study PHP syntax, main features and data types as variables, strings, arrays, loops etc.. 
The main problem was the training tasks (especially task 3). Spent a lot of time reading documentation. And the challenge for me was not to google the solution, but to find it by my own using official documentation.
