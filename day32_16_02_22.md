Day 32.

Solved problems with creating new data by using "handleSubmit" function.
Ceated adding data functions for all tables. Had propblems with redirect because states didn't want to update when the new data was added. Solved problems by using manual reirect in actions.

Also found a bug in browser history (States didn't change during scrolling across the history and data couldn't be loaded). 
So I had to add another one state for rendering "Single element" in every reducer for solving the problem.
