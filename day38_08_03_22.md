Day 38.

Added buttons near checkboxes. 
Created checking car status functions (on sale or not) for having an opportunity to view different status of the checkbox (checked or not).
Added changing status functions. Had problems with its implementing but solved it. 

Had a big problem with form in loop of the posts (the form wasn't creating for the first loop in iteration because of the wordpress core). Solved problem by using fake hidden form.
