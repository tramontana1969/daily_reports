Day 38.

Deleted buttons near checkboxes and added "onclick" action in ckeckbox tag. If checkbox status changes "onclick" calls js function which sends POST request. Also at the same time PHP gets request header and changes post sale status. For that implementation created sparated js file and connetcted it by using hook "admin_enqueue_scripts".
Started working with changing title colors which depend on post sale status. Hawe problems with getting post IDs.
