Day 43.
Created scripts which write random range of numbers into two different files.
The firts script is single threaded. The second is two threaded (by using swoole).
Had problems with connecting "swoole". Solwed it by adding an extension line in "php.ini" file.

Created scripts which find the summary of all numbers in two files. Also implemented it by using single thread and two threads.
